## Why become a Token Miner on the DataHighway?

Toke Miners are rewarded when they commit to **locking** or **signalling** supported cryptocurrencies for a period of time.

## What Mining Speed Boost (MSB) rate multipliers apply to different types of supported tokens?

### Locking

Token Miners may register that they have locked or wish to signal any of the following tokens:
* MXC
* IOTA
* DOT

MXC tokens attract the highest MSB rate multipliers for lock commitments of 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, or 36 months respectively: 1.025, 1.05, 1.075, 1.10, 1.15, 1.2

IOTA and DOT tokens attract the following lower MSBs for same lock commitment periods: 1.0125, 1.025, 1.0375, 1.05, 1.075, 1.1

### Signalling

Token Miners that wish to only signal (rather than locking) attract **10%** of the lower MSBs for the same periods: 1.00125, 1.0025, 1.00375, 1.005, 1.0075, 1.01

## How long is the commitment to lock the tokens?

3, 6, 9, 12, 24, or 36 months
