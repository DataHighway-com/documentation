## Why become a Hardware Miner on the DataHighway?

Hardware Miners are rewarded when they commit to maintaining the uptime of their IoT hardware for a period of time.

## What Mining Speed Boost (MSB) rate multipliers apply to different types of supported hardware?

Hardware Miners may register any of the following IoT hardware:
* Secure LPWAN hardware
* Insecure LPWAN hardware

Secure LPWAN hardware attracts the highest MSB rate multipliers for commitments of 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, or 36 months respectively: 1.025, 1.05, 1.075, 1.10, 1.15, 1.2

Insecure LPWAN hardware attracts the following lower MSBs for same commitment periods: 1.0125, 1.025, 1.0375, 1.05, 1.075, 1.1


## How long is the commitment to lock the hardware?

3, 6, 9, 12, 24, or 36 months
